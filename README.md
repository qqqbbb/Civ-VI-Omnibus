This Omnibus provides three different options for a variety of gameplay overhauls and enhancements.

This Omnibus Mod represents what I've been working towards with my various mod releases, and is a sequel of sorts to my popular Civ V Omnibus Mod and Building Packs. It's purpose is to provide an enhanced and improved "Vanilla-like" experience by focusing on four core goals:

-1--Playing the map

Civ VI has introduced many new elements which increase the importance of the map's geography. In my opinion, however, the game does not go far enough. By tying new district and building bonuses to terrain and resources I hope to encourage you to play more responsively with the map.

-2--Respecting player time and investment

As part of my goal to provide a "Vanilla-like" experience (only better!) I'm not going to overwhelm you with dozens of new buildings, units, techs, civics, policies, etc. If I add something in it's because I think it fits a specific purpose, and I'm always open to changing something I've done if there's a compelling enough reason. 

Another part of meeting this goal is respecting compatibility. I've created different "tiers" within this mod so that you can choose which ones you want to play with, and the "lower" tiers are compatible with almost every mod out there. 

This mod has something for everyone.

-3--Giving the player choices

I don't want you to be railroaded into the same path in every game. Part of my goal with this mod is to make multiple strategies viable, and to give you interesting and compelling choices as to which district to place or which building to build.

As I've already mentioned, I'm also giving you the choice of determining how many of my features you want to play with. The Standard Ruleset makes a few core changes which you can mix and match with almost any other mod. The other rulesets make progressively more changes.

I've also implemented a UserSettings.sql document within the mod. At this time the only item you can turn on/off is Raging Barbarians, but if I find something that would best be completely optional I will add additional features to the UserSettings.

-4--Proper balancing

A truly fun game of civilization is a balanced one, in that no single strategy is a sure-fire way to victory. I'm committed to constantly tweaking and updating this mod based on your feedback, which is crucial to meeting all of these goals.

I hope that you'll help me play and test this modpack to improve the core Civ VI game experience.

-Rulesets

Civilization VI introduces rulesets, a way for modders to provide options within their mods. This mod utilizes this feature extensively by providing three rulesets: Standard, Enhanced, and Complete. In order to select a ruleset other than Standard, you must use Advanced Options when creating a new game and then select from the Ruleset dropdown menu.
